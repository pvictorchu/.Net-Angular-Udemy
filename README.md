# .Net-Angular-Udemy

Hello!

I've created this repository just to keep up with a course I'm attending at Udemy - Build and app with ASPNET Core and Angular from scratch from Neil Cunnings

As the name suggest, I've realized that I needed to study a lot about Angular and learn how to integrate it with .Net 

Anyway, to this moment, that's the only reason that this repository exists
